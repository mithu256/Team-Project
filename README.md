It maintains 5 level of users.

They are,
1.	Admin
2.	Doctor
3.	Patient
4.	Receptionist
5.	Pharmacist




Objectives

   The purpose of the project is to transform the manual process of hospital management     into a computerized system. 
   
o	Doctor : With the help of this system,doctor can schedule his available time slot which will be visible for user.

o	Admin : He can monitor all the activities by go through the system and he is the person who maintain the login details.He have the power to add doctors in the system.

o	Patient : The patient can channel a particular doctor for his disease on his free time.

o	Receptionist : Computerize the patient history and send the history to the doctor when the particular patient has an appointment.

o	Pharmacist : Using this system,he can maintain the stock details and easy to update the stock if it is reduce than a particular amount.




Problem Specifiction

	Admin : In manual system,it is difficult to schedule the free time and it will be take more time to analyse it.

	Doctor : It is difficult to schedule his free time manually without collision.

	Patient : If the patient want to channel a doctor,he has to go to the hospital early and book for an appointment.Sometimes the appointments may be finished on that day.And it is very difficult to maintain his medical history in a flexible manner.

	Receptionist : It is hard to check the appointments and cancel if  they don’t want an appointment.When a patient want to channel a doctor,the receptionist has to send the patient history file on his appointment time.That is very difficult.

	Pharmacist : If a stock is reduced,it is very hard to find which item is reduced from the stock and it will take more time to analyse the stock and update manually.If an item is going to expire,they don’t know about that until they check it.So it may cause more waste of money. In the case of a pharmacist,it is very difficult to maintain Medical history file for each patient.
